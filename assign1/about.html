        <i>What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?</i><br>

        In this project, I ventured into using PHP for the first time, which allowed me to add dynamic functionality to
        the website. I incorporated various features learned from lectures, labs, and online resources to enhance the
        user experience.

      <li>
        <i>Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</i><br>

        One challenge I encountered was the need for IntelliSense for PHP's echo statements in Visual Studio Code.
        Ensuring I was typing the correct syntax was challenging, requiring frequent cross-referencing with the
        style.css file.
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>What would you like to do better next time?</i><br>

        To make the website more engaging, I would like to explore adding animations to some elements and further
        enhancing the modern, dark-themed design.
      </li>

        <i>What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this project? If so,
          please
          include the sources.</i><br>

        Throughout this project, I have gained valuable experience in using PHP and integrating it with HTML and CSS to
        create dynamic web applications. I used various resources to support my learning, such as Stack Overflow,
        YouTube, and online tutorials. These references helped me understand and implement new features and concepts
        effectively.
